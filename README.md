# DigitalGarden
This android application is a personal project I made during my first year as a computer science student.

Digital Garden is an app that helps you manage your house plants.

1. Create a unique profile to each of your plants.

2. Take pictures of your plants and mark their progress.

3. Set watering times for your plants and check up on them.
